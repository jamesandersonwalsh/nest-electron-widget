# nest-electron-widget
Tired of having to launch a new browser tab every time you want to change the temperature on your laptop?

## Description
This electron widget adds a nice menu icon to your desktop so that you can easily access your nest home without having to keep a browser tab open. Please note that I am in no way affiliated with Nest.

## Usage
* Clone the repository and add a `.env` file to the root of the project directory.
* You will need to add the url for your nest thermostat. See the `.env.example` for how to do that. This is the url that will be loaded on app startup.
