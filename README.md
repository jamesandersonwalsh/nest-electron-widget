Tired of having to launch a new browser tab every time you want to check on your nest home? SAME.
So instead here's a nice desktop tray item for nest so that you can easily access your home on the fly.

## Usage üöÄ
* Clone the repository and add a `.env` file to the root of the project directory.
* You will need to add the url for your nest thermostat. See the `.env.example` for how to do that. This is the url that will be loaded on app startup.

```sh
$: yarn && npm run start:dev
```
